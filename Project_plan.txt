READY FOR PHASE 3: Advanced Features & UI/AI Enhancement

Requirement Deep Dive & Scope Definition:

Analyze Documentation (Post-April 2025 Lens): Thoroughly review all provided documents (Moveworks Compound Action Creation, APIthon.md, compound-action-syntax-reference.md, data-handling.md, expression-types.md, moveworks-bender-language-reference.md).

Focus on the role of Compound Actions as components within "Action Activities" in Plugins. [cite: 1, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

Identify all YAML constructs, their mandatory and optional fields, data types, and interdependencies relevant to this context.

Pay special attention to nuances like code: | for APIthon [cite: 1, APIthon.md; 10, Moveworks Compound Action Creation], DSL escaping for constants [cite: 10, Moveworks Compound Action Creation], the different action types (HTTP, Script, Built-in), and control flow constructs [cite: 1, compound-action-syntax-reference.md; 12, Moveworks Compound Action Creation].

Note that Compound Actions are workflow-focused and used for determined tasks within an Action Activity. [cite: 1, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

Define MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Features:

Wizard support for creating a single Compound Action YAML file, intended for use in an Action Activity.

Support for core components: input_args, steps. [cite: 1, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

Support for basic action types: HTTP Action, Script Action (APIthon), and a few common Built-in Actions. [cite: 1, 11, 12, 14, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

Support for at least one simple control flow: switch or sequential steps. [cite: 12, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

Support for progress_updates and delay_config fields within actions. [cite: 1, compound-action-syntax-reference.md]

Basic YAML validation and generation.

Simple command-line interface (CLI) or a very basic GUI.

Define Advanced/Future Features:

Support for all control flow constructs (for, parallel, try/catch, return, raise). [cite: 1, compound-action-syntax-reference.md; 12, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

Full catalog of Built-in Actions. [cite: 14, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

Advanced assistance for creating Moveworks Data Mapping Language (Bender) JSON for the Compound Action's input_args. [cite: 1, moveworks-bender-language-reference.md]

GUI for the wizard.

"AI" features:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) to suggest action types based on user description.

Smart suggestions for input_args based on action type.

Template library for common Compound Actions.

Contextual help, explaining how the generated Compound Action fits into an Action Activity and linking to documentation.

Out-of-Scope (for MVP):

Direct interaction with Moveworks platform APIs (e.g., deploying the YAML).

Generating the full Plugin or Action Activity configuration (wizard focuses on Compound Action YAML only).

Full AI-driven YAML generation from a high-level sentence (start with structured input).

Technical Stack & Architecture:

Language: Python (as requested).

YAML Handling: PyYAML library for parsing and generation.

Wizard Logic:

Start with a rule-based engine. Define classes/objects for each YAML construct (Action, Script, HttpAction, SwitchCase, etc.) that know how to serialize themselves to YAML.

The wizard will interactively populate instances of these classes.

User Interface (UI):

MVP: click for a CLI, or tkinter / customtkinter for a very basic GUI.

Advanced: PyQt6/PySide6, Streamlit, or a web-based framework like Flask/Django with a simple frontend if more powerful UI/UX is needed.

AI Component Strategy (Phased):

Phase 1 (Guided Logic): No true AI, but intelligent prompting based on selected options (e.g., if user selects "HTTP Action," prompt for method, URL, headers, progress_updates etc.).

Phase 2 (Basic NLP/Suggestions): Potentially use libraries like spaCy or a simple keyword matcher to suggest action types.

Data Modeling for YAML Constructs:

Define Python classes or data structures that mirror the schemas provided in compound-action-syntax-reference.md and Moveworks Compound Action Creation.

Ensure these models accurately represent constructs like action, script, switch, for, parallel, return, raise, try_catch as detailed in the syntax reference. [cite: 1, compound-action-syntax-reference.md]

Phase 2: Core Engine Development (MVP) (3-4 Weeks)
Objective: Build the foundational YAML generation logic for Compound Actions intended for Action Activities and a basic user interaction mechanism.

YAML Construct Implementation:

Implement Python classes for MVP constructs (e.g., CompoundAction, InputArg, Step, HttpActionDetails, ApiThonScriptDetails, BuiltInActionDetails, SwitchStatement).

Each class should have methods to:

Accept necessary parameters.

Validate inputs (e.g., required fields, basic data types).

Serialize its state to a Python dictionary structure that PyYAML can convert to correct Moveworks YAML for Compound Actions.

Wizard Logic - Core Flow:

Develop the sequence of questions/prompts for the MVP, keeping in mind the end use in an Action Activity.

Example flow:

Name the Compound Action. Description? [cite: 8, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

Define Input Arguments (input_args) for the Compound Action? (Loop for multiple). [cite: 1, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

Add steps:

Choose action type (HTTP, Script, Built-in).

Based on type, prompt for specific fields (e.g., for HTTP: action_name, output_key, input_args for the HTTP action itself, method, endpoint_url, delay_config, progress_updates etc.). [cite: 1, compound-action-syntax-reference.md]

Handle APIthon code input, ensuring code: | for multi-line scripts. [cite: 1, APIthon.md; 10, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

Handle output_key for actions and scripts. [cite: 1, compound-action-syntax-reference.md]

Implement sequential step addition.

Implement basic switch logic: conditions and their respective steps blocks. [cite: 1, compound-action-syntax-reference.md; 12, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

YAML Generation & Output:

Function to take the populated CompoundAction object and convert it to a YAML string.

Ensure correct indentation and formatting as per Moveworks examples and syntax requirements (e.g., multi-line strings, DSL escaping [cite: 10, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]).

Basic UI/CLI Implementation (MVP):

Implement the wizard flow using the chosen UI/CLI framework.

Display prompts, accept user input.

Output the generated YAML to console or a file.

Phase 3: MVP Testing & Refinement (1-2 Weeks)
Objective: Ensure the MVP generates valid Compound Action YAML suitable for Action Activities.

Unit Testing:

Test individual YAML construct classes for correct serialization.

Test input validation logic.

Integration Testing:

Test the wizard flow with various combinations of inputs.

Validate generated YAML against examples from Moveworks documentation.

Crucially, test the generated Compound Action YAML by manually incorporating it into an Action Activity within a Moveworks test environment (if possible) to ensure compatibility and correct execution. [cite: 2, 3, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

Focus on common pitfalls like incorrect input_args referencing (data.*, meta_info.*) [cite: data-handling.md] or APIthon limitations. [cite: 1, APIthon.md; 13, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

User Feedback & Iteration:

Have a Moveworks developer (or yourself) use the wizard to generate YAML for a typical Action Activity scenario and provide feedback.

Refine prompts and flow.

Phase 4: Advanced Features & UI/AI Enhancement (Ongoing, Iterative)
Objective: Expand functionality, improve user experience, and integrate smarter assistance, always within the post-April 2025 context.

Full YAML Construct Support:

Incrementally add classes and wizard logic for remaining control flow constructs (for, parallel, try/catch, return, raise) as defined in compound-action-syntax-reference.md. [cite: 1, compound-action-syntax-reference.md]

Comprehensive Built-in Action Catalog:

Create a data structure for Moveworks Built-in Actions and their input_args. [cite: 14, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

Data Mapper (Bender) Assistance for input_args:

Provide enhanced support for constructing Bender JSON for the Compound Action's input_args fields. [cite: moveworks-bender-language-reference.md] This could include sub-wizards for common Bender functions like MAP(), CONCAT(), RENDER() etc. [cite: moveworks-bender-language-reference.md]

GUI Development/Enhancement:

If started with CLI, migrate to a richer GUI.

Features: Visual tree of the Compound Action, contextual help explaining parameters and their role when used in an Action Activity.

AI Feature Integration:

NLP for Action Suggestion: User types "I need to get user details and then update a record." -> Wizard suggests appropriate action sequence.

APIthon Snippet Generation: Mindful of APIthon limitations. [cite: 1, APIthon.md; 13, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

Template Library:

Templates for common Compound Actions used within Action Activities.

Guidance within Post-April 2025 Architecture:

The wizard should produce YAML suitable for Compound Actions invoked by Action Activities.

Educational components within the wizard can guide users on when a Compound Action (within an Action Activity) is preferred over direct action chaining within a Plugin for workflow-focused tasks, based on post-April 2025 best practices. This aligns with Compound Actions being used for orchestrating fixed sequences. [cite: 1, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

Phase 5: Continuous Testing, Documentation & Deployment (Ongoing)
Comprehensive Testing:

Expand tests, especially focusing on the integration within an Action Activity context. [cite: 15, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

User Documentation:

README.md and user guide. Emphasize that the output is for Compound Actions designed to be used in Action Activities.

Developer Documentation (if applicable):

Document codebase.

Deployment:

Package the Python application.

Key Challenges & Considerations (Post-April 2025 Focus):
Complexity of Moveworks YAML: Adhering to the stringent syntax remains key. [cite: 1, compound-action-syntax-reference.md]

Interaction with Action Activity Mappers: While the wizard generates the Compound Action YAML, users will need to correctly configure Input/Output Mappers in the Action Activity that uses this Compound Action. The wizard could provide guidance or placeholders in comments. [cite: 3, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

Data Flow: Understanding data flow from Plugin slots -> Action Activity Input Mapper -> Compound Action input_args -> Compound Action steps -> Action Activity Output Mapper -> Plugin context is vital for users. The wizard should clearly define the input_args needed by the Compound Action. [cite: 3, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

Asynchronous Nature: Remember Compound Actions in Action Activities are asynchronous and use "progress updates". The wizard should facilitate adding progress_updates to actions. [cite: 3, Moveworks Compound Action Creation; 1, compound-action-syntax-reference.md]

Testing: Testing requires not just YAML validation, but seeing the Compound Action execute correctly when called by an Action Activity in a plugin. [cite: 15, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]

APIthon Limitations: Strict adherence to APIthon's constraints is necessary. [cite: 1, APIthon.md; 13, Moveworks Compound Action Creation]
